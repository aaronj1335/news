# U.S. Forces Launch Operation to Seize Fleeing Oil Tanker

U.S. forces have launched a high-stakes military operation in the eastern Atlantic to seize the oil tanker formerly known as the Bella 1. The vessel had been attempting to evade a U.S. blockade of sanctioned ships near Venezuela for over two weeks. According to U.S. officials, the operation involved helicopters and at least one Coast Guard vessel, which were deployed to take control of the tanker under law-enforcement authority. The situation was further complicated by the presence of a Russian submarine that had been escorting the tanker through the Atlantic.

The U.S. military presence during the boarding was substantial, utilizing P-8 Poseidon “sub-hunter” aircraft and AC-130J gunships to monitor and secure the operation. Flight-tracking data confirmed the deployment of these assets as U.S. officials prepared to send tanker captains and mechanics on board to operate the vessel. At the time of the pursuit, the ship was described by the White House as a stateless vessel flying a false flag and was already subject to a judicial seizure order.

The Bella 1 has a history of violating international sanctions, having been blacklisted by the U.S. in 2024. It was allegedly involved in transporting black-market Iranian oil for U.S.-designated terrorist organizations aligned with Tehran. This latest seizure effort is part of a broader administration strategy to tighten the blockade on sanctioned vessels and disrupt the financial networks of its adversaries in the region.
