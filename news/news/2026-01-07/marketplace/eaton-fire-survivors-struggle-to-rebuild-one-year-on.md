# Eaton Fire Survivors Struggle to Rebuild One Year On

One year after the Eaton Fire devastated parts of Los Angeles, many survivors remain in a state of housing instability. The Eaton Fire Survivors Network (EFSN) has emerged as a critical advocacy group for these individuals, who are facing the expiration of their insurance benefits. A major point of contention is the Additional Living Expenses (ALE) coverage, which is set to run out for approximately 61% of survivors in the coming months, leaving them without the funds to pay for temporary housing.

The financial burden on survivors is exacerbated by a sharp increase in local rental prices. Pre-fire averages for rent in the affected areas were roughly $1,700, but they have since skyrocketed to between $4,000 and $6,000 per month. This "renter's squeeze" makes it nearly impossible for many to stay in their communities as they wait for the rebuilding process to move forward.

EFSN is currently calling on Southern California Edison (SCE) to provide emergency housing support, citing evidence that the fire was sparked by the company's equipment. In response, Edison launched a "Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program" on October 29, 2025. This program offers up to 42 months of support for those whose homes were destroyed, but it comes with a significant caveat: claimants must waive their legal rights to sue the company in order to receive the assistance.
