# Rebuilding After the LA Fires Starts with Finding a Contractor

For survivors like Dustin Kunkel, the road to rebuilding begins with the daunting task of finding a reliable contractor. In a recent interview, Kunkel described the exhausting process of interviewing between 20 and 40 different contractors before making a selection. He noted that common obstacles included contractors failing to return calls, lack of transparency in their building processes, and pricing that far exceeded initial expectations.

The economic reality of rebuilding in Southern California has shifted significantly. Before the fires, building costs were estimated at approximately $400 per square foot. However, experts now suggest that a more realistic target is $450 per square foot due to increased demand and inflation. These rising costs have forced many homeowners to scale back their plans or seek out specialized groups like Renew Altadena to manage their projects.

Kunkel ultimately chose a contractor that aligned with his specific design and financial goals. His current plan involves constructing a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home, with the potential addition of an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) if his budget permits. This experience highlights the broader logistical and financial hurdles facing thousands of residents as they attempt to navigate the post-disaster construction market.
