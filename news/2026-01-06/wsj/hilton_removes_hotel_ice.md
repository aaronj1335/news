Hilton Worldwide Holdings has taken the significant step of removing a Minneapolis hotel from its global booking system and brand network after the property allegedly refused accommodations to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The property, the Embassy Suites by Hilton Minneapolis Downtown, was scrubbed from Hilton.com and had its dedicated webpage deactivated. This decision followed allegations from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that the hotel had canceled room reservations specifically for its agents.

The hotel’s operator, Everpeak Hospitality, had previously assured Hilton corporate that any issues regarding the refusal of service had been rectified. However, Hilton took definitive action after a video surfaced that contradicted these assurances, according to a company spokeswoman. Hilton emphasized in a memo to its U.S. hotel owners that its properties are "places of public accommodation" and must remain open to all guests, regardless of their professional affiliation or the nature of their work with the government.

The incident highlights the growing role of hotels as flashpoints in the national debate over immigration policy. In Minnesota and other states, protesters have picketed hotels known to house ICE agents, often using noise-making devices to disrupt their sleep. Such demonstrations have frequently led to broader disruptions for other hotel guests and staff. By severing ties with the Minneapolis property, Hilton is reinforcing its brand standards across its entire franchise network, warning other owners that "decisive action" will be taken against any properties that fail to comply with public accommodation laws and company policies.
