The international community, particularly America’s European allies, is responding with growing alarm to President Trump’s renewed demands for Greenland. Denmark has taken a hardline stance, warning that any U.S. attempt to seize the island by force would result in the immediate collapse of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). On Tuesday, major European NATO members issued a rare joint statement backing Denmark and urging the United States to prioritize diplomatic cooperation over coercive measures.

This diplomatic friction is exacerbated by recent U.S. military actions in the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. raid on Caracas that led to the capture of Nicolás Maduro has signaled to allies a shift toward more interventionist "big-stick diplomacy." European leaders fear that the United States is actively dismantling the post-World War II international order, which is built on the principles of state sovereignty and the restricted use of military force. They worry the world is transitioning into an era of "great-power spheres of influence" where regional hegemons like the U.S., Russia, and China dictate terms to smaller nations.

Europe’s response is complicated by its security dependence on the United States. While leaders are privately critical of the Greenland demands and the Caracas raid, many remain hesitant to issue public rebukes because they rely on American military strength to deter Russian aggression. This creates a precarious diplomatic balance: allies must defend the principle of sovereign integrity in Greenland while maintaining a functional alliance with a White House that appears increasingly willing to bypass traditional diplomatic norms.
