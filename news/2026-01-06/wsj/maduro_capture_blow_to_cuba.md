The capture of Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces in January 2026 has dealt a severe blow to Cuba’s intelligence services, which were long considered some of the most proficient in the world. According to Cuban officials, 32 of the approximately 140 Cuban officers assigned to Maduro’s personal security unit were killed during the U.S. raid. These officers were drawn from the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Interior Ministry, representing a significant loss of elite personnel for Havana.

The failure of the Cuban-led security detail to protect Maduro or inflict any casualties on U.S. forces has exposed profound vulnerabilities in Cuba’s security protocols. For decades, Cuban intelligence was a cornerstone of the country's influence in the region, but this event signals a potential decline in their effectiveness. The loss of Maduro not only represents a tactical failure but also a strategic catastrophe for the Cuban regime, which has relied heavily on Venezuelan oil and economic aid since the fall of the Soviet Union.

The economic and political fallout for Cuba is expected to be immense. Analysts predict an "unprecedented economic implosion" as the subsidized oil flow from Venezuela likely comes to an end. This comes at a time when the Cuban regime is already facing internal pressure. High-ranking U.S. officials, including President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have indicated that the collapse of the Maduro regime puts the Cuban government in immediate jeopardy. In a symbolic gesture of mourning and defeat, the Cuban flag was seen flying at half-staff outside the U.S. Embassy in Havana.
