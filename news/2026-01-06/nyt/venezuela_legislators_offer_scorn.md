The Venezuelan National Assembly, predominantly composed of Maduro loyalists, convened on Monday, January 5, 2026, to formally denounce the U.S. operation that captured Nicolás Maduro and Cilia Flores. Nicolás Maduro Guerra, the former president's son and a member of the assembly, led the rhetorical response, characterizing the seizure as an illegal kidnapping. Despite the capture of their leader, the assembly's defiant stance underscored that the 'Chavismo' establishment remains deeply entrenched in Venezuela’s core institutions, including the judiciary and the military.

Interim leader and former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has adopted a dual-tracked approach, publicly calling for 'peaceful coexistence' while the broader legislative body offers scorn toward U.S. actions. This follows President Trump's demands for 'obedience' and a total transition of power, a stance echoed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump administration officials have hinted that there may be a discrepancy between the defiant public rhetoric of Venezuelan officials and their private willingness to negotiate with the United States as the country faces potential economic collapse.

The session at the National Assembly also highlighted the ongoing repression within the country, as security agents reportedly detained several journalists attempting to cover the proceedings. This behavior reinforces the U.S. narrative that the system overseen by Maduro for over a decade is built on a foundation of human rights violations and the hollowing out of democratic pillars. With loyalists still controlling the intelligence agencies and the state-run oil company, the U.S. faces the daunting task of dismantled a vast and resilient state apparatus even after Maduro’s removal.
