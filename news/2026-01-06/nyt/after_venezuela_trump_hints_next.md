The second New York Times article details Donald Trump’s reinvigorated approach to Latin American policy following the operation in Venezuela. Trump has explicitly invoked the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, rebranding it as the “Donroe doctrine” to assert a new era of American dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Proclaiming that the U.S. is now “in charge” of Venezuela, he signaled a shift toward more direct and aggressive interventions in the region to secure American interests and neutralize perceived threats.

A primary focus of this new doctrine is the targeting of regional leaders whom the administration views as obstacles, with Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro being a prominent example. Trump accused Petro of overseeing a "sick" nation and allowing the proliferation of "cocaine mills and cocaine factories" meant for the U.S. market. He suggested that the military forces currently deployed in the Caribbean for the Maduro operation could easily be redirected toward Colombia, stating that an operation against the country “sounds good” to him as a means to curb the drug trade.

The "Donroe doctrine" serves as a blunt instrument of U.S. power, intended to bring regional heads of state to heel through the threat of swift, clinical military action similar to the capture of Maduro. Trump’s assertion that "American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again" underscores a vision of regional geopolitical order defined by U.S. primacy. This policy shift indicates a departure from traditional diplomacy in favor of a security-first approach that prioritizes the elimination of narco-trafficking and the consolidation of American influence across the Americas.
