On January 5, 2026, Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned in Manhattan federal court following their capture by U.S. Delta Force commandos. Appearing before Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, Maduro pleaded not guilty to charges including narco-terrorism, cocaine importation, and firearms offenses. Clad in a navy shirt over orange prison attire, Maduro asserted he had been 'kidnapped' and was a 'prisoner of war,' maintaining that he remains the legitimate president of Venezuela and describing himself as a 'decent man.'

The U.S. government’s case centers on a decades-long conspiracy involving the 'Cartel of the Suns,' through which Maduro is alleged to have facilitated the shipment of hundreds of tons of cocaine into the United States. Federal prosecutors argue that Maduro utilized his control over the Venezuelan state to protect drug trafficking operations and use cocaine as a weapon against the U.S. The prosecution emphasizes that the U.S. hasn't recognized Maduro as Venezuela's leader since 2019, viewing him instead as a criminal usurper who maintained power through fraudulent means.

Maduro’s defense, led by attorney Barry Pollack, intends to argue for head-of-state immunity, a path complicated by the U.S. government's non-recognition of his presidency. This arraignment is a historic first, marking the first time a foreign de facto leader has been forcibly brought to a U.S. court while technically still in power. The legal proceedings are expected to be lengthy and complex, testing international law and the reach of U.S. judicial authority over foreign officials.
