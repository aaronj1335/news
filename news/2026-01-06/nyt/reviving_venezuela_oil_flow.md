Following the capture of Nicolás Maduro, the first New York Times article examines the potential for a recovery in Venezuela's oil production. Chevron, already the largest private oil producer in the country, along with other smaller operators, could potentially increase Venezuela’s oil output to 1.5 million barrels per day within 18 months. However, achieving this target is estimated to require an investment of up to $7 billion and is contingent on the stabilization of the country's political environment and the potential lifting of U.S. sanctions.

Currently, Venezuela's oil production remains at approximately 1 million barrels per day. Even if the industry successfully reaches the 1.5 million barrel-per-day mark, this would represent only slightly more than 1 percent of global oil consumption. Furthermore, this level of production is less than half of the volume Venezuela was pumping in the late 1990s, highlighting the long-term decline and severe disrepair of the nation's energy infrastructure. Experts like energy historian Daniel Yergin suggest that any significant further expansion would likely take years due to the logistical challenges of rebuilding and renegotiating contracts.

Industry leaders, including former Chevron executive Ali Moshiri, emphasize that while the capture of Maduro is a pivotal moment, the pace of recovery will depend significantly on the legal and political framework established by future leadership. Companies are hesitant to commit substantial capital without a clear and stable regulatory environment. Consequently, while the discovery of new potential is present, the economic path forward for Venezuela's oil sector remains fraught with significant financial and political hurdles.
