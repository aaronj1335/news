# Trump Venezuela Oil Power Play

The Trump administration’s strategy in Venezuela has pivoted toward a "realpolitik" approach focused on oil production and regional influence. Following the high-profile seizure of Nicolas Maduro for alleged drug trafficking, the U.S. is working to install and support a pro-U.S. government. The ultimate goal is to take de facto control of Venezuela’s oil reserves, which are the largest in the world but have been severely diminished by years of mismanagement and sanctions.

President Trump recently announced on Truth Social that the U.S. would receive up to 50 million barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan oil, a shipment valued at approximately $2.5 billion. Under this plan, Venezuela would share in the profits from the sales, providing a much-needed cash infusion for the country's teetering economy. Simultaneously, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pressuring acting president Delcy Rodriguez to expel intelligence officials from China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia.

The administrative focus remains on economic restoration rather than immediate democratic reforms. To bring the country "back from the dead," the U.S. aims to reverse the long-term decline in oil production, which fell from 3.5 million barrels per day under Hugo Chavez to just 800,000 barrels per day under Maduro. Currently, Venezuela holds about 30 million barrels of oil in land storage and another 16 million barrels on tankers waiting for export.
