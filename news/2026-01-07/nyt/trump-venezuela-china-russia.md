# Trump's Venezuela, China, and Russia

President Trump’s recent military operation to capture Nicolás Maduro has sent shockwaves through the global geopolitical landscape, forcing China and Russia to reassess their longstanding support for the Venezuelan regime. While both nations have officially condemned the incursion, their reactions have been notably measured, suggesting a willingness to use Venezuela as a bargaining chip in broader negotiations with the United States. Specifically, Fiona Hill, a former national security official, noted that Moscow might be willing to trade its influence in Venezuela for concessions in Ukraine, illustrating Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy.

China’s reaction has also focused on protecting its significant economic interests in the region. Over the past 25 years, Beijing has extended more than $100 billion in loans to Venezuela, largely secured by future oil deliveries. The current instability threatens these investments, leading Chinese officials like Foreign Minister Wang Yi to signal that they are open to cooperation if it results in the relaxation of U.S. export controls and a reduction of military presence in the South China Sea. China’s primary goal remains securing its energy supply and ensuring a return on its massive financial commitments.

Russia’s response, as articulated by former President Dmitri Medvedev, has been surprisingly restrained, with Medvedev even praising Trump for acting in his nation’s interests. This suggests that the Kremlin sees an opportunity to reset relations or at least stabilize the current conflict by working with the Trump administration. The United Nations Security Council mirrored this tension, with a meeting on Tuesday highlighting the divide between those calling for Maduro’s trial in The Hague and those, like Russia and China, who emphasize the need for stability and sovereign non-interference.

Ultimately, the 'assault' on Venezuela serves as a litmus test for Trump’s “America First” agenda on a global scale. By challenging the presence of Russian and Chinese influence in the Western Hemisphere, Trump is testing the limits of their resolve. However, the potential for a 'grand swap' indicates that for the major powers, Venezuela is merely one piece on a much larger chessboard, where regional stability might be sacrificed for domestic or other international gains.
